                    <p>One-liner (or up to 3 sentences) synopsis that pitches and summarizes your game.</p>
                    <p>Use one of these techniques: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Simile - a twist on an existing game - <q>It's Pacman but you can change the maze and attack
                                ghosts!</q></li>
                        <li>Combination - combine 2 existing games - <q>It's Pacman meets Mega Man!</q></li>
                        <li>Primary Action - <q>While avoiding ghosts and other hazards, the player can alter the maze
                                and set traps to eliminate the ghosts.</q></li>

                <section>
                    <h2>III. Platform</h2>
                    <p>Either desktop only, mobile only, "mobile-friendly", tablet, phone, universal.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>IV. Story</h2>
                    <p>Some games are purely abstract and have no story or theme (ex. Tetris).</p>
                    <p> But most games at least have a premise to define the action (ex. Your avatar is running from
                        ghosts in a maze).</p>
                    <p>For your proposed game, discuss the <em>theme</em> (big ideas - if applicable), <em>mood</em>
                        (excitement, fear, ?), <em>narrative</em> (how the player progresses through the game), and
                        <em>premise</em> of the game (what drives the plot).</p>
                    <p>Also discuss <em>player motivation</em>. Give a short summary of what the player is trying to
                        accomplish in the game. Some of this will be recycled from the High Concept section above.</p>

                    <h2>V. Esthetics</h2>
                    <p>Graphics style - abstract, cartoonish, photo-realistic?.</p>
                    <p>Sound - probably pretty simple - 8-bit, ambient, techno, looped, procedural?</p>
                    <p>Discuss the types of sound your game has: scoring, effect, UI, background, zone (varies by player
                        location)?
                    </p>

                    <h2>VI. Gameplay</h2>
                    <h3>Mechanics</h3>
                    <p>What specific choices can the player make and what can they do?</p>
                    <p>Here are some compilations of game mechanics you might find helpful:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="http://www.squidi.net/three/">squidi.net/three/</a></li>

                        <li><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/25/scvngr-game-mechanics/">SCVNGR game mechanics</a>
                            or as <a href="http://www.cram.com/flashcards/game-mechanics-1447848">Flashcards</a></li>

                        <li><a href="http://gamification.org/wiki/Game_Mechanics">gamification.org - Game Mechanics</a>
                        </li>
                    </ul>


                    <h3>Control</h3>
                    <p>Be specific, here are many of the options:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Keyboard and/or mouse</li>
                        <li>Touch and/or gesture (Mobile only)</li>
                        <li>Accelerometer (Mobile only)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Teaching the game/New user experience aka "Onboarding"</h3>
                    <p>How is the player taught how to play the game? Is this integrated into the gameplay, are there
                        separate instructional scenes, a tutorial, or some combination? Is
                        it obvious to the player how to play the game? See <a
                            href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/25/scvngr-game-mechanics/"><cite>Cascading Information
                                Theory</cite> on the SCVNGR game mechanics page.</a></p>

                    <h3>Player learning</h3>
                    <p>Explain some of what the player needs to learn to beat the game. Be specific and cite actual
                        powerups, combos, and strategies. Here we are talking about <i>depth</i> - which is simply
                        (according to Extra Credits) "the number of emergent experientially different possibilities (or
                        meaningful choices) that come out of one ruleset."</p>

                    <h2>VII. Screenshots</h2>
                    <p>Have at least 2 mockup screens of the game. They can be hand drawn and scanned, Photoshop
                        mockups, or scanned <a href="http://gamestorm.tumblr.com">doodles</a> - use &lt;img&gt; tags.

                    <p>Something else you'd like to say that doesn't fit elsewhere. Also discuss any external libraries
                        you might use. All libraries are subject to Professor approval.</p>
