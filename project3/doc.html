                    <h2>I. High Concept</h2>
                    <p>You're fighting an angry matrix trying to linearly transform you into spaghetti, but if you find
                        its reduced row echelon form (rref), you will appease its anger.</p>
                </section>

                    <h2>II. Genre</h2>
                    <p>I think this would be classified under the 'action' genre, but more generally it would be
                        educational for people who want practice finding rref form, and I can extend this further to
                        practice different techniques used in linear algebra.</p>

                    <h2>IV. Story</h2>
                    <p>You are trapped in a land of matrices, all of which will attack you and kill you unless you can
                        reduce them to their rref form. Each matrix you encounter will become more and more difficult to
                        reduce until you reach the grand 5x5 boss matrix. Will you save yourself?</p>

                    <h2>V. Aesthetics</h2>
                    <p>I think I want to try to use an 8-bit style just for simplicity's sake. At the same time, I think
                        it would also help create an experience that looks "techy" because although the premise of the
                        game is set in a mathematical world, I am dealing with matrices which have many 1s and 0s. I
                        will include sound, which is to have a couple of 8-bit sound effects whenever matrix rows are
                        swapped, pivoted, or scaled. I will try to animate the numbers if possible. I'll have a looping
                        soundtrack in the background, likely some non-copyrighted 8-bit action music track.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>VI. Gameplay</h2>
                    <h3>Mechanics</h3>
                    <p>At minimum, the player should be able to swap, pivot, and scale rows of a matrix. These are EROs
                        (elementary row operations) that can be applied to any matrix to reduce them. This will
                        correspond with "weakening the matrix", even if I don't end up adding a bit of strategy to the
                        game (for example, the top-left entry of a matrix corresponds to the power of its attack). The
                        player can make only a certain amount of moves in a set time frame, so the player has to work
                        efficiently but also think quickly or risk spaghettification.</p>

                    <h3>Control</h3>
                    <p>Keyboard and mouse only</p>

                    <h3>Teaching the game/New user experience aka "Onboarding"</h3>
                    <p>The player will be taught how to play a game in a "tutorial"-style format, in which they will be
                        presented with several beginning levels, teaching them each of the possible operations. There
                        will be one level each teaching players a pivot, a row swap, and scaling a row. Then, the levels
                        will slowly ramp up in difficulty. The tutorial will only be displayed once.</p>

                    <h3>Player learning</h3>
                    <p>To beat the game, the player has to learn how to reduce a matrix to its reduced row echelon form.
                        They must do so efficiently and quickly, or they risk running out of moves or time. This means
                        the player has to learn not just to click buttons, but to follow a procedure that will allow
                        them to quickly reduce a row down to its rref. As the levels progress, they will become more and
                        more familiar with this overall process and will be capable of tackling any matrix, even
                        matrices which are bigger than 3x3 and 4x4.</p>

                    <h3>Reflection</h3>
                    <p>
                        I had a lot of fun building this project. Although I originally had a lot more planned, it was
                        still a blast learning how to build this website from scratch. I think I might pick this project
                        back up during the break or another time. The original idea was to create a game, in which you
                        would have to figure out how to reduce a matrix to its RREF as quickly and in as few moves as
                        possible, but that is an extra feature that I may implement in the future. For now, it acts as a
                        tool you can use to practice, containing several "levels" that progressively get more difficult.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Successes</h3>
                    <p>I'd say there are a lot of things worth celebrating about this website.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Simple, but it's so fun playing with the hover effect of matrix elements. It's like a trail
                            that follows your mouse.</li>
                        <li>When scaling a row, I use an event listener that detects a change in the input box. I then
                            validate the input box using the math.js library, only allowing the user to scale the matrix
                            with a valid number. I think it's a great UX addition.</li>
                        <li>The algorithm used to check if a matrix is in RREF was written completely by me, as well as
                            the auto RREF feature which solves the matrix for you. These were two things that started
                            out as ideas but I implemented them when I realized that I could spend the time to slowly
                            figure out how to do so.</li>
                        <li>I implemented the text highlighting when they change, which shows the user what is being
                            changed.</li>
                        <li>I thought I would have to rely on libraries to perform matrix operations, but it was
                            actually a blast to implement each of the elementary row operations (Swap, Scale, Pivot)
                            myself.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3>Setbacks</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>I HATE floating point numbers with a passion. I tried to use the decimal.js library to solve
                            some of the problems I had but they're not completely gone. I would say I was successful in
                            adding a couple of workarounds. For example, if a number is really small, it gets set to 0,
                            or if it is really close to a whole number, it gets rounded. Numbers which don't fit within
                            the bounds of the element will become scientific notation.</li>
                        <li>There's a weird CSS glitch where if you add a transition to the transform and also include a
                            border, the border seems to "stay behind" for a moment when your mouse leaves the box. I'm
                            not sure why, it's weird.</li>
                        <li>It took me probably two hours to figure out how to fix all the matrix elements in the
                            container without it overflowing, while keeping the matrix container square and not
                            stretching all over the place. The solution? A flexbox and some javascript. Praise the Lord
                            that flexboxes save lives.</li>
