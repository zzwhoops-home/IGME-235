                    <h2>I. High Concept</h2>
                    <p>You're fighting an angry matrix trying to linearly transform you into spaghetti, but if you find
                        its reduced row echelon form (rref), you will appease its anger.</p>

                    <h2>II. Genre</h2>
                    <p>I think this would be classified under the 'action' genre, but more generally it would be
                        educational for people who want practice finding rref form, and I can extend this further to
                        practice different techniques used in linear algebra.</p>

                    <h2>IV. Story</h2>
                    <p>You are trapped in a land of matrices, all of which will attack you and kill you unless you can
                        reduce them to their rref form. Each matrix you encounter will become more and more difficult to
                        reduce until you reach the grand 5x5 boss matrix. Will you save yourself?</p>

                    <h2>V. Aesthetics</h2>
                    <p>I think I want to try to use an 8-bit style just for simplicity's sake. At the same time, I think
                        it would also help create an experience that looks "techy" because although the premise of the
                        game is set in a mathematical world, I am dealing with matrices which have many 1s and 0s. I
                        will include sound, which is to have a couple of 8-bit sound effects whenever matrix rows are
                        swapped, pivoted, or scaled. I will try to animate the numbers if possible. I'll have a looping
                        soundtrack in the background, likely some non-copyrighted 8-bit action music track.</p>

                    <h2>VI. Gameplay</h2>
                    <h3>Mechanics</h3>
                    <p>At minimum, the player should be able to swap, pivot, and scale rows of a matrix. These are EROs
                        (elementary row operations) that can be applied to any matrix to reduce them. This will
                        correspond with "weakening the matrix", even if I don't end up adding a bit of strategy to the
                        game (for example, the top-left entry of a matrix corresponds to the power of its attack). The
                        player can make only a certain amount of moves in a set time frame, so the player has to work
                        efficiently but also think quickly or risk spaghettification.</p>

                    <h3>Control</h3>
                    <p>Keyboard and mouse only</p>

                    <h3>Teaching the game/New user experience aka "Onboarding"</h3>
                    <p>The player will be taught how to play a game in a "tutorial"-style format, in which they will be
                        presented with several beginning levels, teaching them each of the possible operations. There
                        will be one level each teaching players a pivot, a row swap, and scaling a row. Then, the levels
                        will slowly ramp up in difficulty. The tutorial will only be displayed once.</p>

                    <h3>Player learning</h3>
                    <p>To beat the game, the player has to learn how to reduce a matrix to its reduced row echelon form.
                        They must do so efficiently and quickly, or they risk running out of moves or time. This means
                        the player has to learn not just to click buttons, but to follow a procedure that will allow
                        them to quickly reduce a row down to its rref. As the levels progress, they will become more and
                        more familiar with this overall process and will be capable of tackling any matrix, even
                        matrices which are bigger than 3x3 and 4x4.</p>
