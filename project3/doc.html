                    <h2>I. High Concept</h2>
                    <p>You're fighting an angry matrix trying to linearly transform you into spaghetti, but if you find
                        its reduced row echelon form (rref), you will appease its anger.</p>

                    <h2>II. Genre</h2>
                    <p>I think this would be classified under the 'action' genre, but more generally it would be
                        educational for people who want practice finding rref form</p>

                    <h2>IV. Story</h2>
                    <p>You are trapped in a land of matrices, all of which will attack you and kill you unless you can
                        reduce them to their rref form. Each matrix you encounter will become more and more difficult to
                        reduce until you reach the grand 5x5 boss matrix. Will you save yourself?</p>

                    <h2>V. Aesthetics</h2>
                    <p>I think I want to try to use an 8-bit style just for simplicity's sake. At the same time, I think
                        it would also help create an experience that looks "techy" because although the premise of the
                        game is set in a mathematical world, I am dealing with matrices which have many 1s and 0s. I
                        will include sound, which is to have a couple of 8-bit sound effects whenever matrix rows are
                        swapped, pivoted, or scaled. I will try to animate the numbers if possible. I'll have a looping
                        soundtrack in the background, likely some non-copyrighted 8-bit action music track</p>

                    <h2>VI. Gameplay</h2>
                    <h3>Mechanics</h3>
                    <p>What specific choices can the player make and what can they do?</p>
                    <p>Here are some compilations of game mechanics you might find helpful:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="http://www.squidi.net/three/">squidi.net/three/</a></li>

                        <li><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/25/scvngr-game-mechanics/">SCVNGR game mechanics</a>
                            or as <a href="http://www.cram.com/flashcards/game-mechanics-1447848">Flashcards</a></li>

                        <li><a href="http://gamification.org/wiki/Game_Mechanics">gamification.org - Game Mechanics</a>
                        </li>
                    </ul>


                    <h3>Control</h3>
                    <p>Be specific, here are many of the options:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Keyboard and/or mouse</li>
                        <li>Touch and/or gesture (Mobile only)</li>
                        <li>Accelerometer (Mobile only)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Teaching the game/New user experience aka "Onboarding"</h3>
                    <p>How is the player taught how to play the game? Is this integrated into the gameplay, are there
                        separate instructional scenes, a tutorial, or some combination? Is
                        it obvious to the player how to play the game? See <a
                            href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/25/scvngr-game-mechanics/"><cite>Cascading Information
                                Theory</cite> on the SCVNGR game mechanics page.</a></p>

                    <h3>Player learning</h3>
                    <p>Explain some of what the player needs to learn to beat the game. Be specific and cite actual
                        powerups, combos, and strategies. Here we are talking about <i>depth</i> - which is simply
                        (according to Extra Credits) "the number of emergent experientially different possibilities (or
                        meaningful choices) that come out of one ruleset."</p>

                    <h2>VII. Screenshots</h2>
                    <p>Have at least 2 mockup screens of the game. They can be hand drawn and scanned, Photoshop
                        mockups, or scanned <a href="http://gamestorm.tumblr.com">doodles</a> - use &lt;img&gt; tags.
                        You can either display the images in this section, or somewhere else on the page.</p>

                        you might use. All libraries are subject to Professor approval.</p>
