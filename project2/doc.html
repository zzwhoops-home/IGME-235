            <h2>Overview & Goals</h2>
            <p>For Project 2, I will be creating a search feature for the Art Institute of Chicago's public API. I'm
                sure it already exists on their website itself, but I just want to create a clean interface that feels
                easy to use. I will use CSS grid or flexbox to arrange artwork results in rows of three. Each artwork
                will be displayed as equally-sized squares with some spacing. Hovering over them will display
                information about the image and allow the user to click on the image, with in-window 'pop-up'-like
                dialogues if the user clicks on the description. If I end up having extra time at the end of the
                project, I will create a "favorites" feature in which the user can "star" artworks that they like and
                create a custom collection, stored in local storage.</p>
            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this project is to create a streamlined search tool to find art from the Art Institute of
                Chicago. You can find artworks on their website, but it is not always easy to find what you're looking
                for. Is the tool revolutionary? No. But it will provide a nicer interface (in my opinion) for the user
                to interact with.</p>
            <h2>Audience</h2>
            <p>There is no target audience, really. It's for those who appreciate art and want to be able to explore
                what the Art Institute of Chicago has to offer. For all ages and eyes. For those who aren't blind.</p>

            <p>Okay, I got into the flow of development and so I'm reflecting on what I'm proud of after the fact, but
                this should be most of it</p>
            <ol>
                <li>All the CSS animations/JS work really nicely, and I spent a lot of time making the animations flow
                    very smoothly (just try out the page)</li>
                <li>Cool fade in animation when the results load or are sorted</li>
                <li>Ignore the loading gif (please)</li>
                <li>The dropdown menu with filters "slides" open (click the dropdown below the search bar)</li>
                <li>There are technically 4 controls: search, relevance filter, # of results, and sorting (try out all
                    the controls)</li>
                <li>The sort updates the items already on the page without additional input (try changing the sort
                    method)</li>
                <li>Every control's state is saved in local storage (reload the page after setting filters)</li>
            </ol>

            <ol>
                <li>I have used the Art Institute of Chicago API. It supports CORS and does not require an API key or
                    OAuth</li>
                <li>The last search term is saved and reloading the page causes the term to persist</li>
                <li>There is a search bar, relevance filter, # of results filter, and sorting by lexicographical or
                    chronological means</li>
