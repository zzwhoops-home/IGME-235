            <h2>Overview & Goals</h2>
            <p>For Project 2, I will be creating a search feature for the Art Institute of Chicago's public API. I'm
                sure it already exists on their website itself, but I just want to create a clean interface that feels
                easy to use. I will use CSS grid or flexbox to arrange artwork results in rows of three. Each artwork
                will be displayed as equally-sized squares with some spacing. Hovering over them will display
                information about the image and allow the user to click on the image, with in-window 'pop-up'-like
                dialogues if the user clicks on the description. If I end up having extra time at the end of the
                project, I will create a "favorites" feature in which the user can "star" artworks that they like and
                create a custom collection, stored in local storage.</p>
            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this project is to create a streamlined search tool to find art from the Art Institute of
                Chicago. You can find artworks on their website, but it is not always easy to find what you're looking
                for. Is the tool revolutionary? No. But it will provide a nicer interface (in my opinion) for the user
                to interact with.</p>
            <h2>Audience</h2>
            <p>There is no target audience, really. It's for those who appreciate art and want to be able to explore
                what the Art Institute of Chicago has to offer. For all ages and eyes. For those who aren't blind.</p>

            <p>Okay, I got into the flow of development and really didn't get a chance to document every little detail
                that I'm proud of, but here's what I can think of</p>
            <ol>
                <li>All the CSS animations/JS work really nicely, and I spent a lot of time making the animations flow
                    very smoothly</li>
                <li>Cool fade in animation</li>
                <li>Ignore the loading gif</li>
                <li>The dropdown menu with filters "slides" open</li>
                <li>There are technically 4 controls: search, relevance filter, # of results, and sorting</li>
                <li>Every control's state is saved in local storage</li>
                <li>The sort updates the items on the page already</li>
            </ol>
