        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            <strong>Dig Dug</strong> is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way through the earth.<br>
            Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called Pooka and Fygar, who will continually chase you around.<br>
            The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode. [...]

            This definitely goes under the heading of "Games That Were Made While a Programmer Was on Drugs," or at least had a good imagination. And maybe they were into horror movies too.
