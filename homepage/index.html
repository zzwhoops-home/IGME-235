            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p class="page-text">Hi! My name is Zach. I'm a double major in Game Design & Development and a custom major through RIT's School of Individualized Study (SOIS) program which I call "AI-powered social-emotional learning". I'm passionate about integrating games, AI, and technology into interdisciplinary educational environments to enhance student learning. I want to obtain a breadth of knowledge in many subject areas, even in those outside of technical contexts such as project management and leadership. By the time I graduate, I hope that I will have worked on innovative project that blend AI and game development to promote effective academic and social-emotional learning.</p>
