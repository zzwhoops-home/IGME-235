        <p>For project 1, I will be creating a portfolio of some of the past projects I have worked on. The reference I will be attempting to recreate is from a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BacktotheFuture/comments/w07ru4/i_was_reading_a_scan_of_an_old_back_to_the_future/#lightbox">Reddit post</a> detailing a theory that fans had about Back to the Future. I have three projects that I would like to place on the page. Some preliminary thoughts:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A home page which displays all of my projects in some accessible, neat way</li>
            <li>Stacked sections for each of my projects</li>
            <li>An "about me" section, links to my resume and GitHub, etc...</li>
        </ul>
