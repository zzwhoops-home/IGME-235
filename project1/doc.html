            <h3>Overview & Goals</h2>
            <p>For project 1, I will be creating a portfolio of some of the past projects I have worked on. The reference I will be attempting to recreate is from the pre-chosen layouts. It is a paper detailing RIT's athletic facility improvements from an 2022 President's Report. Some preliminary thoughts on what I will have for the final product:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A home page which displays all of my projects in some accessible, neat way</li>
                <li>Stacked sections for each of my projects</li>
                <li>An "about me" section, links to my resume and GitHub, etc...</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I am seeking to create a website that is clean, easy to navigate, and professional for any prospective employers. As a result, the layout from RIT's news worked well for me. I can have a main banner at the top with my name and maybe a couple things about me, and then stack my projects below, perhaps in an additional section too and have them go three-wide. I'm not sure if I will keep the banner at the bottom of the screen but I could definitely put my contact info with a nice background.</p>
